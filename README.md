Soccer League Coordinator

An App (Playground, no GUI) to help a soccer coach divide 18 players into three well-balanced teams.

I have volunteered to be the coordinator for my town’s youth soccer league.
As part of your job I need to divide the 18 children who have signed up for the league into three even teams — Dragons, Sharks, and Raptors.
In years past, the teams have been unevenly matched, so this year I am doing my best to fix that. 
For each child, I used the following information:

- Name,
- Height (in inches),
- Whether or not they have played soccer before, and Their guardians’ names.
